Data Format Validation
Now we will see how we can validate our entered form data before submitting it to the web server.

The following example shows how to validate an entered email address. An email address must contain at least a ‘@’ sign and a dot (.). Also, the ‘@’ must not be the first character of the email address, and the last dot must at least be one character after the ‘@’ sign.

Example
Try the following code for email validation.

<script type = "text/javascript">
   <!--
      function validateEmail() {
         var emailID = document.myForm.EMail.value;
         atpos = emailID.indexOf("@");
         dotpos = emailID.lastIndexOf(".");
         
         if (atpos < 1 || ( dotpos - atpos < 2 )) {
            alert("Please enter correct email ID")
            document.myForm.EMail.focus() ;
            return false;
         }
         return( true );
      }
   //-->
