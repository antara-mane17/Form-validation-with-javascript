# Form-validation-with-javascript
basic tutorial for Form validation with javascript 
On a user registration form, there are certain rules you want your users to follow when inputting values to register on your site. Some of those rules include:

Some input fields cannot be empty
Some values must be in a particular length range
Some input fields must match (for example, password fields)
There are many more rules but let's leave it at these basic rules. In this tutorial, we are going to perform form validation on all the input fields concerning the rules we just listed.

Create three files and name them:

register.php
index.php
scripts.js
style.css
